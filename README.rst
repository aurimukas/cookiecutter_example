cookiecutter_example
====================

## Purpose
An example project that I will be using to formally publish my development notes from a few projects.
This is a staging ground that is utilized for integrating different, common components in a basic application.

## Using the repo
The repository is subject to changes as branches are added for different articles. After each article, they'll likely be merged into the main project.
These branches will _not be deleted_, this is to preserve the code used in each article as needed.

### Articles
These are published to my publication [here](https://medium.com/matthew-wimb). This project is subject to changes as it is integrated into articles.
